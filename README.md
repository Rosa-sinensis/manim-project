# Manim Animation
My side project, crafted just for fun.
I also wanted to know what it takes to develop an animation by using just lines of code.
This is also my attempt in animating equation that I have been equipped
 with throughout my education 
as well as equations that are visually aesthetic.

### What I get from this?
1. Mathematics is an art. 
2. Producing a good animation took time.  ^.^

### Future plan:
- Insert and animate the equation for each curve shown
- Improve animation
- Model mobius strip
- Model a spinning donut
